# Data-Structers-Foundation
Some of the Data Structers projects I have done

# What I learned
1.	Use linked lists as a problem solving technique.
2.	Use recursion as a problem solving technique
3.	Apply linear structures such as stacks and/or queues to a variety of problems
4.	Represent trees and graph, with their standard manipulation algorithms
5.	Use different techniques of searching and sorting.
6.	Evaluate various alternatives and select appropriate ADTs
